# Java Learning Land

JAVA Learning Land (JLL) is a non-profit organization that helps other people to learn and develop new skills in JAVA. Our community will start by collecting learning source material for JAVA at all levels. Therefore we create [JAVA Learning Archive](https://github.com/ErdemOzgen/Java-Learning-Archive)(Still in Progress). PRs are welcome.
